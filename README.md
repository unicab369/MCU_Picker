# MCU Picker

A centralized reference for microcontroller pinouts, peripheral mappings, and chip specifications.

This project is under active development. While we strive for accuracy, please consult the official hardware manuals for critical applications, as some information may be incomplete or require updating.

Right now most of the works have been mainly for the WCH ICs.
